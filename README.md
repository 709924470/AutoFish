# AutoFish

Minecraft Mod, coremod style, __only for 1.13.2__, **NOT SUITABLE FOR FORGE**

There's some thing wrong with auto setup(double clicking the jar), so please __DO NOT ONLY__ use it to install but following the instructions below.

## For __MultiMC__ Launcher Users

---

- Open the jar by double clicking
- Select your .minecraft folder
  - Usually located in `launcher's folder/instances/1.13.2/`
  - If anything went wrong please put them in issue, use command line run `java -jar autofish-1.0.jar` to get error log
- Open `launcher's folder/instances/1.13.2/patches/cn.settile.autofish.json`, copy everything in it
- Open the launcher, click `Edit instance`
- Then `Version` -> `Add Empty`
  - Name is `Autofish`, uid is `cn.settile.autofish`
- Then click `Edit`, paste things you've just copied
- Now the mod should be working, check out in game~
